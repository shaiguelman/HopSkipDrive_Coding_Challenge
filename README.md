Possible Improvements
___________________

1. Should use persistent memory library such as room instead
of single shared ViewModel.

2. Should pass OnClickListener object to list adapters instead
of entire ViewModel.

3. Should use more style elements instead of manually styling
the text views.

4. Could have used drawn bitmaps instead of using png files.
